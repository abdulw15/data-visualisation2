            <p>A zoomable circle packing is a type of interactive visualization that displays hierarchical data as a set of nested circles. In this visualization, each circle represents a segment, and the size of the circle is proportional to the percentage value of that segment. The circles are arranged in a hierarchical structure, with the largest circle representing the highest level of the hierarchy and the smaller circles representing the lower levels. Users can interact with the visualization by zooming in and out, and clicking on a circle to reveal its children. The interaction with this visualization allows users to explore the hierarchy of the segments and compare the proportion of each segment across different social media platforms. For example, by clicking on the largest circle representing "None" for the Custom segment, users can see that the majority of the respondents did not provide any information about their social media use. By clicking on the circle representing "Instagram" for the Mac or PC segment, users can see that the largest proportion of respondents who use Instagram also prefer Macs over PCs. This visualization is particularly useful for displaying a large amount of hierarchical data in an interactive and visually appealing way. The zoom and click functionalities allow users to explore the data and uncover patterns that may not be immediately obvious in a static visualization. Additionally, the use of circles to represent the segments allows for easy comparison of the proportional values between segments.</p>

            <p>A zoomable sunburst is a data visualization technique that displays hierarchical data in a circular format. It allows users to interactively explore the data by zooming in and out of the different levels of the hierarchy. The outermost circle represents the highest level of the hierarchy, with each subsequent level represented by an inner circle. The wedges in the circle represent the different segments or categories within each level. One possible interaction with the zoomable sunburst is to highlight a particular segment or wedge when the user hovers over it. This can be achieved using the "mouseover" event in d3.js. For example, when the user hovers over the "Mac or PC? Mac" wedge, the corresponding percentages for each social media platform can be displayed. The highest wedge of the social media platforms in the "Mac or PC? Mac" category is "None" at 32.1%. This suggests that a significant portion of individuals who use Macs do not use any of the social media platforms included in the dataset. The next highest wedge is "Instagram" at 37.5%, followed by "Facebook" at 21.5%, "Twitter" at 6.4%, and "Snapchat" at 2.6%. This information can be useful for marketers and social media companies looking to target individuals who use Macs, as it provides insights into which platforms are most popular among this group. For example, they may want to focus more on Instagram and Facebook, which have a higher percentage of users among Mac users, and less on Snapchat, which has a lower percentage.</p>
